# EDSiteProject
A website with various tools for the [Elite Dangerous game](https://www.elitedangerous.com/). This website is a work in progress. A demo version of the website is hosted on Heroku [here](http://edsite.arthurvanremoortel.me).

In this game you play as a pilot of a spaceship. The game takes place in a very large simulation of the Milky Way with around 400 billion stars and thousands of space stations.
The in-game tools to explore these large amounts of data are very basic and not very useful. This lead to the creation of many community-developed tools.

This website will allow you to explore the large quantities of data from the game, as well as post and share you fleet carrier missions so other players can more easily find good trade opportunities.
